<h1>A little bit about my YouTube Carreer</h1>

<hr>

<p>I started YouTube I think in 2015 and I posted my first video in December 29, 2015. It was titled <em>"What the?"</em> Where I was just spinning my head around and just having a little fun. Very Random Video right? Well a year later I realesed another video which was me actually trying to make a video with my friend Saimon. Then after that video I tried uploading more and more and one of my videos, dont even know how, blew up with 16k veiws! It was a video Titled <em>"7 second challenge w/Shrisha"</em> It was a video with my Cousin(Shrisha). After that I started to post alot more, hit 50 subs then I still dont know why to this day, I quit. Then I tried to start my YouTube Carreer again but I quit again. So now I am starting on YouTube again and trying not to quit.
